1.  Originally my-express was in public/canvas_file_caches/githubmine location but there was a warning that the owner of the folder was different from the current user. 
1. I decided to start from scratch with a new repository and work on documents folder
1. ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "usergolden25@canvas.ed"
1. config file in .ssh : Host github User nelsonlopezjimenez IdentityFile in ssh id_ed25519
1. Copied and pasted all except node_modules and dot git because it did not want to run. But when it did it gave too many warning about deprecated packages. 
1. Also, when I tried to copy/paste the symlinks in the my-express/public folder it was trying to copy everything. Not sure how git handles symlinks but I will have to recreate them and when pulling from github see what happens with the symlinks in the public folder.
1. npm install express, cors
